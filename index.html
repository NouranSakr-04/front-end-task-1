        <h1><hr><strong>WHAT'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE </strong></h1>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. 

            Artificial intelligence allows machines to model and even improve upon the capabilities of the human mind. From the development of self-driving cars to the proliferation of smart assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI is a growing part of everyday life. As a result, many tech companies across various industries are investing in artificially intelligent technologies.</p>
